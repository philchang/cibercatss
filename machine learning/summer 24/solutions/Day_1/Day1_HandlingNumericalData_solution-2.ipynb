    "## 1.6 Handling Outliers\n",
    "Similar to detecting outliers, there is no hard-and-fast rule for handling them. How we handle them should be based on two aspects. First, we should consider what makes them an outlier. If we believe they are errors in the data such as from a broken sensor or a miscoded value, then we might drop the observation or replace outlier values with NaN since we can’t believe those values. However, if we believe the outliers are genuine extreme values (e.g., a house (mansion) with 200 bathrooms), then marking them as outliers or transforming their values is more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, how we handle outliers should be based on our goal for machine learning. For example, if we want to predict house prices based on features of the house, we might reasonably assume the price for mansions with over 100 bathrooms is driven by a different dynamic than regular family homes. Furthermore, if we are training a model to use as part of an online home loan web application, we might assume that our potential users will not include billionaires looking to buy a mansion.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what should we do if we have outliers? Think about why they are outliers, have an end goal in mind for the data, and, most importantly, remember that not making a decision to address outliers is itself a decision with implications.\n",
    "\n",
    "One additional point: if you do have outliers standardization might not be appropriate because the mean and variance might be highly influenced by the outliers. In this case, use a rescaling method more robust against outliers like RobustScaler.\n",

For example, we might believe there is very little difference in the spending habits of 19- and 20-year-olds, but a significant difference between 20- and 21-year-olds (the age in the United States when young adults can consume alcohol). In that example, it could be useful to break up individuals in our data into those who can drink alcohol and those who cannot.

    "## 1.9 Imputing Missing Values\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main strategies for replacing missing data with substitute values, each of which has strengths and weaknesses. First, we can use machine learning to predict the values of the missing data. To do this we treat the feature with missing values as a target vector and use the remaining subset of features to predict missing values. While we can use a wide range of machine learning algorithms to impute values, a popular choice is KNN.  KNN is addressed in depth later, but the short explanation is that the algorithm uses the k nearest observations (according to some distance metric) to predict the missing value. In our solution we predicted the missing value using the five closest observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The downside to KNN is that in order to know which observations are the closest to the missing value, it needs to calculate the distance between the missing value and every single observation. This is reasonable in smaller datasets, but quickly becomes problematic if a dataset has millions of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative and more scalable strategy is to fill in all missing values with some average value. For example, in our solution we used scikit-learn to fill in missing values with a feature’s mean value. The imputed value is often not as close to the true value as when we used KNN, but we can scale mean-filling to data containing millions of observations easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we use imputation, it is a good idea to create a binary feature indicating whether or not the observation contains an imputed value.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem\n",
    "You have missing values in your data and want to fill in or predict their values.\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "If you have a small amount of data, predict the missing values using k-nearest neighbors (KNN):"
