        "***Intro:*** Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns patterns or structures from unlabeled data. \n",
        "\n",
        "***The key difference between supervised and unsupervised learning:*** Unlike supervised learning, which requires labeled data with input-output pairs, unsupervised learning algorithms work on data without any predefined output labels or target variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "***The objective of unsupervised learning*** is to discover inherent patterns, relationships, or structures within the data. It aims to uncover hidden insights, group similar data points together, or identify meaningful representations of the data without any prior knowledge or guidance.\n",
        "\n",
        "***Common tasks in unsupervised learning include:***\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Clustering techniques: Grouping similar data points together based on their characteristics or proximity.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing the number of features or variables in the data while preserving its essential information.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Anomaly Detection: Identifying unusual or rare instances that deviate significantly from the norm.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Association Rule Mining: Discovering interesting associations or relationships between different variables in the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unsupervised learning algorithms rely on mathematical techniques such as clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means, DBSCAN), dimensionality reduction methods (e.g., PCA, t-SNE), and density estimation techniques (e.g., Gaussian Mixture Models) to learn patterns and extract valuable insights from the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unsupervised learning has various applications, including customer segmentation, recommendation systems, anomaly detection, image and text analysis, and data exploration. It plays a crucial role in exploratory data analysis and can provide valuable insights when dealing with large, unstructured, or unlabeled datasets."
