Instead, we often encounter various datasets from different sources, such as multiple database queries or files. To consolidate all the data into a unified structure, we can load each query or file into separate DataFrames in pandas and then merge them together to create a single DataFrame.\n",

        "Secondly, we need to specify the column(s) on which the merge will be based. These columns contain values that are shared between the two DataFrames. Both DataFrames have a column called \"employee_id\". The merge operation will pair up the values in the \"employee_id\" column of each DataFrame. If the column names are the same, the \"`on`\" parameter can be used. However, if the column names differ, we can use \"left_on\" and \"right_on\" to specify the corresponding column names from the left and right DataFrames.\n",

This terminology becomes relevant again when discussing the subsequent parameters.\n",
